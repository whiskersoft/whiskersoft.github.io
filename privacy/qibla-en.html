      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains what data the QiblaFinder app (“App”) processes and how it is used.
        The App needs access to certain device data in order to provide core features such as Qibla direction,
        prayer times, and audio Quran. We do not collect directly identifiable personal information such as your
        name, email address, or phone number.
      </p>

      <h2>Data We Collect and Process</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Location (approximate/precise):</strong>
        We use your device location to calculate the Qibla direction and, optionally, to display prayer times.
        Location data is primarily processed on the device. When fetching prayer times, only your latitude/longitude
        is transmitted anonymously to the Aladhan service.
        In addition, approximate location may be processed by Google AdMob and its partners for ad delivery,
        measurement, frequency capping, fraud prevention, and legal compliance.
        This data is not stored by us, is not linked to your identity by us, and is not used to track you in the
        background while the app is closed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Device sensors (compass, accelerometer, gyroscope):</strong>
        These are used in real time to keep the Qibla arrow aligned and stable. Sensor data is not sent to external
        systems and is not logged by us.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Network access and third-party content:</strong>
        For the audio Quran feature, MP3 files are streamed from VerseByVerseQuran / EveryAyah
        (<a href="https://www.versebyversequran.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">versebyversequran.com</a>,
        <a href="https://everyayah.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everyayah.com</a>).
        Some text/data files may be hosted on GitHub (githubusercontent.com).
        In these requests, your IP address and client information can be seen by the respective server as part of
        normal internet communication. The app itself does not implement any additional tracking or analytics.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Payments and subscriptions:</strong>
        Premium features, donations, or subscription purchases within the app are handled via the Google Play Billing
        system. Your credit card details, full payment history, and financial data are not visible to us, are not
        processed by us, and are not stored by us. All payment processing is performed under Google’s security
        and privacy standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Local storage / caching:</strong>
        Audio files and some content may be cached locally on your device to improve performance.
        This data is stored in the app’s local storage area. You can remove it by clearing the app data or
        uninstalling the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Notifications:</strong>
        Local notifications are scheduled for prayer time reminders and other alerts.
        These notifications may include sound and vibration. You can disable them at any time from within the app
        or via your device settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Advertising ID and technical data (Google AdMob):</strong>
        For ad delivery, frequency capping, fraud and abuse prevention, and legal compliance,
        the advertising ID (AAID), device model, OS version, approximate location derived from IP address,
        and similar technical signals may be processed by Google AdMob and its advertising partners.
        This processing is handled under Google’s own privacy policies and controls.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use the Data</h2>

      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
      <p>

        </li>
        <li>
          For personalised advertising and certain ad-related technologies, consent may be requested
